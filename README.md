### BlackJack Project

# What does it do
When launching the app, the dealer will deal you and themselves 2 cards. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible and beat the dealers score. If you get 21, you've earned a blackjack and win. 

# How does it work
When the app. launches, the dealer will deal you both 2 cards. if you or the dealer get 21 on the deal, you will win with Blackjack. The dealer hand always wins on blackjack. If nobody gets blackjack on deal, you the player will be asked if you want to hit or stay. If you choose to hit, the dealer will deal you another card. If the card dealt to you makes the total sum of your cards go over 21, you bust and lose the game. If you choose to stay, the dealer will then get to take their turn. If the total sum of the dealers cards are below 17, the dealer must hit. If the total sum of the dealers cards of 17 or greater, the dealer must stay. Whoever has the higher score at the end of the dealers turn wins. You will then be asked if you want to play again. If you choose yes the game will restart. If you choose no, the app will close.
